# Blueprint: AI-Powered Flutter App

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and development plan for a Flutter application built with the assistance of an AI coding partner. The goal is to create a modern, robust, and visually appealing application by leveraging automated code generation, dependency management, and adherence to best practices in Flutter development.

This blueprint will serve as a living document, updated with each new feature and change request.
